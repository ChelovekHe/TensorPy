## Running TensorPy Examples

(NOTE: If you didn't install TensorFlow and TensorPy properly from the README instructions, these scripts won't work.)

```bash
./run_test_classify.sh
```

You can also run the Python code directly:

```bash
python test_classify.py
```

(NOTE: If you see any ``*.pyc`` files appear as you run tests, that's perfectly normal. Compiled bytecode is a natural result of running Python code.)
