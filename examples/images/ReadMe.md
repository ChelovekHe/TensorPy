### Here are some cool animals!

**(For testing image recognition)**

File names are purposely made ambiguous to demonstrate that classifications are based on the image itself and not the image name. Classifications aren't always perfect: "water_animal.jpg" is an image of a dolphin, but TensorFlow classifies it as a type of shark. TensorFlow's neural net model can be trained to perform better (more on that later!).
